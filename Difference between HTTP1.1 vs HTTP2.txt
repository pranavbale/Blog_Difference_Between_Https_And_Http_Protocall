Before differencing let us understand what is HTTP. HTTP is an file transfer protocal. Hipper Text Transfer Protocal 
is an longform of HTTP.
The general function of HTTP is to transfer a data form one machine to another machine. The data will be transfer 
from one machine to another machine with the help of TCP protocal.

Let consider machine A and machine B want to comminate with each other. The machine A send the request to machine B 
and then machine B send the response to machine B. machine B also contact to machine A and in this way both machine 
will contact with each other.

HTTP has type let discuss some of this type 

1.	HTTP 1.1
The HTTP 1.1 is an first type of HTTP protocal. The machine A contact machine B with the help of sending the plain 
text massage form and Machine B also contact with the plain text massage form. The HTTP 1.1 protocal canâ€™t send 
second protocal until the first protocal complete.

2.	HTTP 2
HTTP 2  is an one of the another type of HTTP protocal. In an HTTP 2 protocal machine A contact with machine B with 
the help of send the binary format and machine B also send response to machine A with the binary format. More than 
one TCP protocal will be work at the same time.
